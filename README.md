## 🚀 About Eventify

Eventify was developed as part of my **3-month internship at Anypli**, where I had the opportunity to learn and apply **programming**, **database manipulation**, and **Laravel** development skills.  
While this platform was created *within* the company environment, it is **my personal internship project** and not an official Anypli product.

The idea behind Eventify is simple yet powerful: **every event, big or small, deserves to be unforgettable**.  
The project was designed to address common challenges in event management that existing tools often overlook:

- **No more fragmented tools** — plan, communicate, and manage in one unified platform.
- **No steep learning curves** — an intuitive interface built for real people, not just tech experts.
- **No one-size-fits-all** — customizable pages and flexible features adapt to *your* vision.

- **Learning & applying Laravel** for backend development.

- **Collaborating** with other interns on side projects.
